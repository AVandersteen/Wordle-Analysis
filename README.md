# :iphone: Am I any good at Wordle?

**Key skills used**: Data cleaning, Data Analysis, Writing and Visual communication, statistics <br>
**Tools used**: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib), SQL Database, Microsoft Excel <br>

I love playing Wordle, and I also love sharing my performance with friends and family. My competitive side can often get the best of me, and I find myself in a war to best whoever I send my score to. But without any general leaderboards, I can't compare myself to anyone but my friends. So, how do I create my own Wordle leaderboard? And can I determine if I'm above average at the game?

In order to accomplish these goals, I've broken the project into three general stages with accompanying files and process descriptions.

 1. Retrieving data (tweetScrape)
 2. Aggregating & cleaning data (dataCleaning)
 3. Analysis (dataAnalysis)
